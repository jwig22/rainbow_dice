# rainbow_dice
Streamlit version of the game Qwixx.

Roll the dice and mark your card (external to this app) given the options. Follow rules from game Qwixx. When a color gets locked out, check the lockout box on the left panel. When three colors are locked out or the penalty lockout is checked, the game ends and must be reset.
